    "\n",
    "- **Branches** are simply the names we assign to a timeline of commits\n",
    "    - Effectively a labelling system\n",
    "    \n",
    "- So far, we've only been working on the master branch\n",
    "    - As we'll see, we can create a **feature branch** to make some updates without messing with our main production code\n",
    "        - When we're satisfied with our new feature, we can **merge** the feature branch back into the master branch\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Types of Merges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast-forward merge**\n",
    "    - Simplest case\n",
    "        - Occurs when nothing new has been added to the master branch while we've been working on the feature branch\n",
    "    - As if we never created a new branch (and we were working on the master branch the whole time)\n",
    "        - The commits are moved from the feature branch to the master branch\n",
    "    - Can be disabled\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Automatic merge**\n",
    "    - Occurs when changes have been made to the master branch while we've been working on the feature branch\n",
    "        - The changes, however, don't cause problems with one another\n",
    "    - Both timelines are preserved\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Manual merge**\n",
    "    - This is the trickiest case\n",
    "        - Occurs when changes made in one branch interfere with changes made in another\n",
    "            - That means that automatic merging is impossible\n",
    "    - The owner needs to decide which code to keep, and which to discard"

    "    - Before we commit this update to master, we want to create a new branch and commit it to there first\n",
    "        - To **create a new branch and switch over to it**, we use the following command:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```shell\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- Now, to merge the branches, we use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git merge update_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since this merge is so simple, the commit message will tell us it's a *fast-forward merge*\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don't need update_branch (since it's basically just a series of tags), so we can delete it wil the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git branch -d update_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note:** this doesn't mean that the history gets deleted, just that they're now associated with the master (and we removed duplicated tags)"
