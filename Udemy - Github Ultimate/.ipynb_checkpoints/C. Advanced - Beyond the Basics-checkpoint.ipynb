    "    - As we'll see, we can create a **feature branch** to make some updates without messing with our main production code\n",

    "### Types of Merges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast-forward merge**\n",
    "    - Simplest case\n",
    "        - Occurs when nothing new has been added to the master branch while we've been working on the feature branch\n",
    "    - As if we never created a new branch (and we were working on the master branch the whole time)\n",
    "        - The commits are moved from the feature branch to the master branch\n",
    "    - Can be disabled\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Automatic merge**\n",
    "    - Occurs when changes have been made to the master branch while we've been working on the feature branch\n",
    "        - The changes, however, don't cause problems with one another\n",
    "    - Both timelines are preserved\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Manual merge**\n",
    "    - This is the trickiest case\n",
    "        - Occurs when changes made in one branch interfere with changes made in another\n",
    "            - That means that automatic merging is impossible\n",
